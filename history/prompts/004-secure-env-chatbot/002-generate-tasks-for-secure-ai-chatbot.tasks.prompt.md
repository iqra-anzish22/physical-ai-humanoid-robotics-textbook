# Generate Tasks for Secure AI Chatbot

## Prompt Text
$ARGUMENTS

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for the Secure Environment Setup + AI Chatbot Integration feature, organizing implementation work by priority (P1-P3) with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.

## Outcome Impact
Created structured task breakdown that maps to user stories and functional requirements, enabling incremental delivery and independent testing of each feature component.

## Tests Summary
none

## Files Summary
- specs/004-secure-env-chatbot/tasks.md: Complete task breakdown organized by phases and user stories

## Next Prompts
None needed - tasks document is complete and ready for implementation.

## Reflection Note
The task breakdown follows the incremental delivery approach with clear dependencies between user stories while enabling parallel execution within stories.

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - all design documents were properly loaded and tasks were generated according to the template requirements.

## Next Experiment to Improve Prompt Quality
None needed - the tasks document was successfully generated with proper structure and organization.
