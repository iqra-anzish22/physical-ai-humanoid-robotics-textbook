## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are embodied and operate in the physical world. These systems must deal with real-world physics, sensorimotor control, environmental uncertainty, and the complex interactions between digital intelligence and physical reality.

### Key Characteristics

- **Embodiment**: Systems have physical form and presence
- **Real-time interaction**: Must respond to dynamic environments
- **Physics-aware**: Understanding and leveraging physical laws
- **Uncertainty management**: Dealing with noisy sensors and unpredictable environments
- **Sensorimotor integration**: Coordinating perception and action

## Applications of Physical AI

Physical AI has numerous applications across various domains:

- **Robotics**: Autonomous robots for manufacturing, service, and exploration
- **Autonomous vehicles**: Self-driving cars, drones, and other mobile platforms
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, rehabilitation devices, and assistive technologies
- **Agriculture**: Autonomous farming equipment and precision agriculture
- **Space exploration**: Planetary rovers and space maintenance robots

## Challenges in Physical AI

Working with Physical AI systems presents unique challenges:

- **Reality gap**: Differences between simulation and real-world performance
- **Safety and reliability**: Ensuring safe operation in human environments
- **Learning efficiency**: Acquiring skills with limited physical interaction time
- **Multi-modal perception**: Integrating visual, tactile, auditory, and other sensory inputs
- **Physical constraints**: Dealing with weight, power, and mechanical limitations

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore the core concepts of Physical AI in more detail, including the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding.
