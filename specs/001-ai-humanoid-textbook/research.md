# Research: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Research Summary

This research document addresses the technical decisions and investigations needed for implementing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook using Docusaurus framework.

## Decision: Docusaurus as the Documentation Framework

**Rationale**: Docusaurus is an ideal choice for this textbook project because it's specifically designed for documentation sites, offers excellent MDX support, has built-in features for technical documentation, and provides responsive design out of the box. It supports internationalization for the Urdu translation requirement and has strong community support.

**Alternatives considered**:
- GitBook: Less flexible than Docusaurus, limited customization options
- Hugo: More complex setup, not as beginner-friendly for content authors
- Custom React app: Requires significant development time for basic documentation features
- Sphinx: More Python-focused, less suitable for the diverse tech stack of this project

## Decision: Chapter Structure and Organization

**Rationale**: Organizing content into 6 core modules (Physical AI intro, ROS 2, Gazebo & Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Humanoid robotics, VLA basics) follows the specified requirements and provides a logical learning progression. Each chapter will have a consistent structure with learning outcomes, content, diagrams, exercises, and summaries as required by the constitution.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Topic-based organization: Could work but wouldn't follow the specified module order
- Skill-based progression: Would require restructuring the specified content order

## Decision: Urdu Translation Implementation Approach

**Rationale**: Using Docusaurus's built-in i18n (internationalization) functionality is the best approach for Urdu translation. This approach maintains MDX compatibility as required by the constraints and integrates seamlessly with the Docusaurus framework without breaking existing functionality.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom translation toggle component: More complex to implement and maintain
- Separate Urdu version of the site: Would duplicate content management effort
- Manual language switching: Would be harder to maintain consistency

## Decision: Content Format - MDX/Markdown

**Rationale**: MDX format is selected because it allows for rich interactive content while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown. It's fully supported by Docusaurus and allows embedding React components for features like translation toggles and learning outcome displays.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure Markdown: Limited interactivity for educational components
- HTML: More complex to author and maintain
- RestructuredText: Less suitable for the target audience

## Decision: Deployment Strategy

**Rationale**: GitHub Pages or Vercel deployment provides free hosting, version control integration, and global accessibility required for the textbook. Both platforms support static sites generated by Docusaurus and provide reliable uptime.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Self-hosted solution: Higher maintenance overhead
- Other cloud platforms: Would require additional configuration without clear benefits

## Decision: Academic Citation Format

**Rationale**: APA format is implemented using standard Docusaurus Markdown syntax with proper citation formatting. This meets the requirement for verified robotics content with proper academic citations.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Other citation formats: APA is the specified requirement and standard for academic work
- Bibliography management tools: Would add complexity without significant benefit for this project

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Docusaurus supports all required features: responsive design, mobile compatibility, navigation, search functionality
- Custom React components can be created for learning outcomes, exercises, and translation toggle
- MDX allows for interactive diagrams and examples while maintaining accessibility
- The modular structure supports both current requirements and future Part-2 expansion
